First of all Ricardo to whom I ripped is nice comicbook wrapper, and has now added new features to the script himself! Thanks!

The following people must be credited for their work that I have used directly or at least as inspiration for this script:

- cYo for developing comicrack. Please consider [donating](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/donate) to cYo to keep comicrack alive!

- The following guys at the comicrack forum for their code I have boldly ripped for my own purposes (in no particular order):

  * [Stonepaw](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/forum/profile/userid-1094), mostly for the part for moving files, ripped from his great [Library Organizer](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/forum/13-scripts/11603-library-organizer) script.

  * [cbanack](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/forum/profile/userid-5321) for several functions I used for cleaning up the series and files names from his wonderful [Comic Vine Scraper](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/forum/32-news-and-announcements/11493-comic-vine-scraper-1033-1037) script.
